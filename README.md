# VLab
VLab is a modern online web-based physics laboratory. VLab is designed to facilitate students in conducting experiments wherever they want. VLab provides a wide range of realistic and interactive physics simulations, allowing students to gain hands-on experience without the need to go to traditional physical laboratories. This is supported by a user-friendly UI design and the implementation of AI in its simulations.
